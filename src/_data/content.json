        "We provide individual writers and their immediate families with housing, healthcare, visas, translation services, professional resources, and a stipend for a minimum of two years. To the best of our abilities, we tailor our support to each writer's extenuating circumstances and creative needs. Our goal is to offer respite so that they may recover from the trauma of extradition and lay the groundwork for longterm personal and professional success.",
        "We are not trying to \"save\" people or use these artists for our own creative ends. We do not weigh in on the content of their writing or ask them to assimilate.",
        "If the writer is interested in building local relationships, we can offer writing and teaching opportunities through literary organizations, publishing houses, and universities."

        "City of Asylum PDX is a member of the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN). In 1993, a group of writers led by Salman Rushdie formed the International Parliament of Writers. At the behest of the IPW, governments in several European cities agreed to provide one to two years of support for endangered writers in exile. These were called \"Cities of Asylum,\" and they aimed to protect not only freedom of speech and freedom of publication but also the physical safety of writers. The IPW eventually dissolved in 2003, but its mission was picked up by the International Cities of Refuge Network (ICORN) – a non-governmental organization established in 2006, based in Stavanger, Norway. Since then, more than 80 cities across Europe, the United States and Latin America have joined the network. ICORN enables cities around the world to provide safe haven for persecuted writers and artists. The network actively collaborates with PEN International, Reporters without Borders (RSF), ProtectDefenders (PD), Arts Right Justice, Al Mawred, Artists at Risk Connection (ARC), Scholars at Risk, Frontline Defenders, DefendDefenders, Freemuse, UNESCO and many more, to improve conditions for freedom of expression worldwide.",
        "Abroad, most Cities of Asylum are literal cities, facilitated by the cooperation of the communities' municipal governments. However, in the United States, City of Asylums operate as nonprofits within cities, funded by grants and partnered with universities. Currently, there are active branches in Ithaca, Detroit, Las Vegas, and Pittsburgh. City of Asylum PDX is proud to be the first American West Coast chapter of this global network."

    "story": [
      "Together, we are two creative professionals who have been friends for over fifteen years.",
      "Annika's father is from Australia, Selina's father is from Switzerland, and yet both sets of parents happened to settle down the street from each other in Eugene, Oregon. We grew up in international, literary, creative households where reading was constant and television rare. Still, we did not meet until high school, when Annika cast Selina in a school play.",
      "We parted ways for college and remained intermittently in touch over the following years as we zigzagged across the country for our careers. Over a decade later, we were delighted to discover we had moved back to Oregon with our respective fiancés within months of each other. Grateful for connection in a new city, we began discussing our desires to participate in and contribute to the local literary community. We were struck by the fact that as eighteen-year-old artists, both of us felt we had to leave Oregon in order to accomplish our creative ambitions. Our imaginations and literary tastes were developed here; why, then, had it felt so necessary to take those dreams elsewhere?",
      "We began to ideate on an Oregon-based organization that would connect us to the larger literary world and the global struggle for free speech, while simultaneously fostering artistic industry within Portland. We wanted to combine our politics with our craft in our home state where our earliest creative impulses began. We are so grateful to call Oregon home. Especially now, as so many places are robbing themselves of life, art, and community by shutting their doors against anyone unfamiliar–we can be a refuge that invites people in, starts discussions, opens minds, and deepens roots."
